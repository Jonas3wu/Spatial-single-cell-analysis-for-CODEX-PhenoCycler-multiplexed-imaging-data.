# Spatial-single-cell-analysis-for-CODEX-PhenoCycler-multiplexed-imaging-data.
In this end-to-end analysis, it took a multichannel .tif slide image, performed tissue extraction + cell segmentation, exported per-cell features into .csv, then run region-wise preprocessing, neighborhood analysis, clustering/annotation, and spatial plotting (cell types/clusters overlaid on the image).
